<!-- Certainly! You can explain the use of `useRef` in your React code with this definition:

**Definition of `useRef` in React:**

The `useRef` hook is used to persist a value across renders without causing a re-render when the value changes. It provides a mutable object that can hold a reference to a DOM element or store a value. Unlike state, updating a `useRef` value does not trigger a component re-render.

hello

**Explanation in Your Code:**

1. **Tracking Renders:**
   In your code, `useRef` is being used to keep track of the number of times the component re-renders.

   ```jsx
   var count = useRef(0);
   ```

   The `count` variable is a mutable reference object with an initial value of `0`.

2. **Updating the Ref:**
   Inside the `useEffect` hook, `count.current` is incremented every time the component renders:

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
       count.current = count.current + 1;
       console.log(count.current);
   });
   ```

   This does not trigger another re-render, making it efficient for tracking purposes.

3. **Displaying the Value:**
   The `count.current` value is displayed in the UI to indicate the number of renders:

   ```jsx
   <h1>rendered {count.current}</h1>
   ```

4. **State and Re-Renders:**
   The `value` state is updated using the `setValue` function, which triggers a re-render. The `useRef` value (`count.current`) allows you to see how many times the component re-rendered when the state changes.
